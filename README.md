# alien_invasion
This is a basic alien invasion style game for python using pygames


You must have all the files downloaded into one repository in order to play this game.
Run the game in your terminal by cd'ing into the directory which these files are
located and then run python alien_invasion.py. Use the arrow keys left and right to
stear the ship and use the spacebar to fire. Lives are located in upper left of the
screen, top center is the high score, top right is your score and the level you are on.

The game runs at different speeds on each computer depending on your processing speed.
If the game is too slow or too fast open the settings.py file and change the 
self.ship_speed_factor, self.bullet_speed_factor, and self.alien_speed_factor up or down 
depending on how fast or slow your computer runs. You may also want to change the dynamic 
settings of the self.alien_speed_factor as well as the self.speedup_scale. All of these are 
located in the settings.py file.
